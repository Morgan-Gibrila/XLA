                        <p>My learning objectives for the XLB project were to be a more politically active-awered citizen of the Netherlands and strengthen my skills in the visual expression of thoughts and feelings through graphic design.</p>

                    <p>During the project, I tried to challenge myself and leave my comfort zone to become a more skillful designer. So then I signed up for some courses but finished only one because it took work to make a work-life balance. In addition, I bought some books about graphic design, which I had read, and that principle I applied to my work. So then, the works were more balanced and approachable to the viewers. But at the same time, during experimenting and creating the posters, I reached some limits, like fear of being ugliness and rejection by people. Sometimes Alex Zakkas told me that my posters are not disturbing; they do not show the emotions of people who experience discrimination in the Netherlands. As a result, I had to push myself to achieve the goal.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I wanted to talk about different events of discrimination that international students face. Still, I ended up with one specific topic I was part of- the housing crisis. I was just so overwhelmed by this world's unfairness that I couldn't be silent. What was interesting was when I interviewed students and wanted to use their stories for my work, they were so scared, they were afraid because they didn't want to be canceled by the dutch society. Many international students are unsatisfied with living conditions in the Netherlands, and daily, they experience rejection and discrimination from the Dutch people. Still, they are scared to say they are not okay with this situation. As a result, it is tough to say something to post because you know you are going to be under attack of the public judgement.</p>

                        <p>I wanted to know the definition of "home" for the international students, so then I can understand their feelings about NL and how hospitable and comfortable it is to live here.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Fight</h2>
                <p>Metaphors, sarcasm, going back to the childhood</p>

                        <p>The main message of the posters is about how The Student Housing Agency in the Hague crosses the line with its financial schemes and makes people suffer from psychological pressure or create unbearable conditions for living. In addition, this agency was even advertised on the university's websites: THUAS and Leiden University, which made people think that it was an excellent place to rent, but in the end, it turned out as a nightmare for the victims.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 3: destruction</h2>
                <p>I should have paid more attention to the aesthetics but refused. I divided into the chaos of emotions and feelings-> I put myself into the international students' shoes who don't have a right and are powerless against the big world. Having talked with some of them for a while, I realized they were stuck in a situation they couldn't escape. The thoughts they are having about it are eating them out alive. This is an actual reality of life for the international students fighting for their rights in the Dutch Housing market.</p>
