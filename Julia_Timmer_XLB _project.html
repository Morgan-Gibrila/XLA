                        <p>In Experience Lab, I got the opportunity to develop my self as a person and as designer. The project taught me to express my own experiences and perspective into my design projects and to look deeper into myself.</p>

                <p>It was really fun to work on this project, because I had so much creative freedom. It gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about 3D design with guidance of my mentor. I learned the hard way that it seemed way easier then I thought.</p>

                        <p>This was such a totally different project then I did for XLA. This time I'm not working with a client but with an expert. I don't need to satisfy the client but express my own thoughts. I feel like I don't need to have a strict plan but can go with the flow. I do have some ideas on what steps could help me during the creative process.</p>

                        <p>I feel like I work best under pressure. I'm a huge procrastinator. It feels like my mind doesn't work when I don't feel any pressure. I can't come up with anything creative. Sometimes this can be a struggle. Especially, when there are no deadlines.</p>

                        <p>This time I was so excited about trying out Spline that I didn't need to push myself to work on this project. I was putting other things off to work on this. I watched a lot of tutorials and looked at so many examples.</p>

                <h2>EXPLORATION</h2>
                <p>The first step was an exploration by looking at creations of different artists. Furthermore, I started thinking about what is going through my mind when I design something.</p>

                <h2>THINGS I TRIED</h2>
                <p>The next step was following a basic tutorial from the Spline youtube channel. I created a small room. It was pretty easy, because I was able to follow all the steps exactly.</p>
                <p> Next I tried to create different shapes of rooms and also arches. This was much more difficult to figure out, because it there weren't any tutorials about this. This was my biggest struggle during the project. Spline is a super new program and it's not very well know yet. Usually when you try out a program like blender you can simply google a questions and there are a milion answers. With Spline this wasn't the case. I have also noticed a lot of bugs. For example, the program would react in different ways even though I edited a shape the exact same way as before. Or the scene wouldn't respond anymore or the shape were invisible for some time. Also the interactions didn't work a 100% of the time.</p>
                <p>Renee is an expert in 3D and has worked a little bit in Spline but also doesn't know all the ins and outs of the program yet. This made it very difficult to ask questions more in detail. However, along the way I did get really valuable feedback that helped me. She noticed things that I didn't think about and she gave me feedback on my design concept.</p>

                <h2>CREATING MY IDEA IN FIGMA</h2>
                <p>After I tried creating some different eye shapes in Spline and realized how much time it took me. I decided to make a prototype of my design concept in Figma. It was easier to experiment with the colors, composition, and fonts. I will explain more about what it means on the upcoming pages.</p>

                <h2>WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</h2>
                <p>When I'm designing I love creating experiences that engage the various different senses. I created my own symbols which represent what is important to me when designing. I integrated these symbols into the design by positioning it into my abstract "cloud of thoughts".</p>

                <h2>DOUBLE MEANING</h2>
                <div class="main_text_grid">
                    <div class="main_text_grid_text_no_vert">
                        <p>I love digital design but electronic devices have so many negative effects on someone's well being. As UX designer you create systems that invade someone's privacy. You create something that makes people stuck to their screens.</p>
                        <p>The eyes represent that we are always being watched. Where ever you go you are being "followed".
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="main_text_grid_text_no_vert">
                        <p>The most important message behind my design isn't obvious to everyone. Most importantly it reminds me to always keep this in mind and to never forget what I learned from my own experiences. I always wanted to help people and work on something that would improve our society. That's why I started studying biomedical sciences in the first place. I found out that it wasn't for me, because I couldn't express my creativity. In UX I can express my creativity and I enjoy doing it so much. But I also realised the negative effects.</p>
