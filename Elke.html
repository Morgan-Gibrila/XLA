                        <p>For my XLA project, I was enthusiastic about some of the proposed topics, like for example; the XLA radio and the SUX initiative. After giving it a lot of thought, and getting inspired by my peers choosing their own project, to explore and learn from, I decided I wanted to do my own personal project as well. </p>

                        <p>It wasn’t an easy decision, as it required me to think about what truly motivates me to learn more about, it could’ve been anything, from learning a new skill, how to use a specific tool, to something more profound...like my future career. I decided to go with the latter.</p>

                        <p>I’ve been thinking about this ever since I started my second year, what to do after I graduate. During the first year we had a wide variety of courses and it was pretty intense, but by the end of that year I still wasn’t quite sure in which direction to go. I thought maybe I would get a clearer idea in the second year, waiting to have more courses and see if maybe there was a new course I would also like. </p>

                    <p>Since I decided to do a minor instead of an internship in the first semester, I did not get to experience what it was like to be a UX designer in a company or agency. Therefore, the thought about what kind of UX designer I want to be remained, and when I finally came into that realization of “maybe this is what I can do for XLA”, I discussed it with the teachers and the rest is history.</p>

                        <p>Afterwards, I had to find someone who could help me navigate this topic, give me some bit of structure and provide me with some tools so I could start exploring this further. I immediately thought of my minor tutor, Nico. He’s doing his graduation project from the IDE program and he’s interested in the same things as I am. When I asked him if he could be my mentor for the XLA project and he said yes, we began embarking on this journey, on my journey into figuring out my path as a UX designer.</p>

                        <p>It was decided and it was part of the objectives we set for this course, that we would explore different mediums for ideas and reflections, such as books, audios, and interviews. As this mix would benefit me more because it would help me explore and approach the topics in a better way, as well as help me find out what I like. Along the way I had an unexpected and surprising addition to this project, a job! All of that will be documented in this blog, as it will take place week by week.</p>
