                        <p>In this tutorial I will be using the 2021 version of Unity Editor, and I’m working on the computer with a Windows operating system. Unity provides us with two types of templates that can be used to develop VR games, but I am going to use the 3D core template, because VR template is being supported by the different editor version.  </p>
                        <p>So let’s give a name to the project and press Create.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Device integration & build settings</h2>
                        <p>The first step that we are going to do after opening project is to go to File > and Build settings.
                            As a default, the platform is set up for [Windows, Mac and Linux], but we're going to build for
                            Android, so we should choose this setup, and then press Switch Platform.
                            There is one more important section in here - the [Run device settings]. At that moment you can
                            see that it is set up for [Default device], but as soon as you will connect your meta headset for a
                            testing, you should be able to select this specific device.</p>
