                        <p>I have a click with antique and vintage items, and I enjoy the experience of discovering these items from flea market, antique stores, and such. From this assignment I would like to go further with this interest and transform it into my side business. I want to do research on the items and be able to share with my audience.</p>

                </div>

                <p>On the other hand, running a social media and to promote on social media are getting more challenging. It is not just about listing an item and put a price, but also how do you set up a brand identity and communication with audience. Therefore, I also want to focus on the business aspects.</p>

                    <p>Antique stores and flea markets can be unpredictable, and many times I was empty-handed after a visit that took me a few hours to get there. Additionally, as a beginner, I encountered difficulty accurately identifying and researching the items I found. While the internet can be a valuable resource, many things are difficult to trace back.
                        
                    <p>As a result, I had trouble bargaining and determining the value of items. I got “scams” from market dealers and underestimated an item’s value, but I’d say that these situations made me more experienced. For now, I can at least spot if the item is just a retro replica or if the dealer provides misleading information</p>
